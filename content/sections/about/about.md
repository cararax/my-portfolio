Hi,

My name is Pedro Carara and I'm a Brazilian backend developer passionate about what I do.

I have about 2 years of experience in web development with a focus on backend. I'm majoring in Internet Systems Technology at UFSM.

My biggest goal is to develop applications that influence the lives of thousands of people.

My main skills are to develop and maintain REST APIs and Microservices with Java, Spring Boot and SQL/NoSQL databases, always using the best techniques to maintain code readability.

Welcome to my portfolio. Feel free to get to know some of my projects and/or feel free to contact me :).
